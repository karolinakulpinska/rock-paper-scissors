# Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this activity, I've worked with a partner to build a rock-paper-scissors game using only JavaScript.

### User story:
  * I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.
  * I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
  * I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.
  * The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.
  * I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.
  * I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after 10 rounds.

### Rules for rock-paper-scissors

* Rock: wins against scissors, loses to paper, and ties against itself.
* Paper: wins against rock, loses to scissors, and ties against itself.
* Scissors: wins against paper, loses to rock, and ties against itself.

### I began the process by pseudocoding the game.
